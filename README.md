Codewars Challenges : Is there a duplicate value?
This codewars challenge required me to return true if there was a duplicate element in the given string. 
If there was no duplicate detected then the functions returned false. 
The parameters:
  Boolean test if input string has duplicate values return 'False'. 
  Boolean test ignores the letter case.
  Boolean test must analyze input even if duplicate characters may not be adjacent 
  to each other. 
What I learned from this:
  if statements, string manipulation, true/false logic, for statements
